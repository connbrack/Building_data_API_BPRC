# Kaizen_API
This repo is a resource for the building team at Carleton University. It provides example API calls and workflows for those working on buildings equipped with coppertree Kaizen cloud based data collection.

This project contains the following files:

***API_Examples***
* The primary file to reference. This contains several example API calls along with two work flow examples.

***API_puller***

***coppertree_documentation***
* This folder contains the coppertree documentation that the examples are based on

***login_info***
* This file is intentionally omitted for security reasons but is reqired to run. Contact Connor Brackley (connor.brackley@mail.concordia.ca) for more info
