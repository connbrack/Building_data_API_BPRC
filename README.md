# Building Data API BPRC

This repo is a resource for the building team at Carleton University. It provides example API calls and workflows for those working on buildings equipped with coppertree Kaizen cloud based data collection.

This project contains the following files:

***API_Examples***
* The primary file to reference. This contains several example API calls along with two work flow examples.

***API_puller***
* Contains an API_puller function referenced in the API_Examples file. This puller takes in a dataframe of sensor points and batch downloads the Kaizen data into a single time normalized dataframe.

***Requirements***
* Contains requirements to set up a virtual environment (standard packages are used, so this may not be necessary)

***Omitted Documents***
* login_info is intentionally omitted for security reasons. If you require this document or do not have the most current version contact Connor Brackley (connor.brackley@mail.concordia.ca) for more info
	* The current version of login_info is login_info_v2.txt
